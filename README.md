You need to have a C++ 13.2 version or newer and <b>make</b> install on your device. Your device needs to support uint8_t, uint16_t, and uint32_t.

```bash
// git clone this repo
// run Makefile using the command in the repo
make
// It should create a query.exe file
// execute that file
./query.exe
```
